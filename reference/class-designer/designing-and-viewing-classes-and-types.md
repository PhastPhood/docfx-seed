# Design and view classes and types

Design, visualize, and refactor classes and other types in your code with **Class Designer** in Visual Studio. Use class diagrams to create and edit classes in your C#, Visual Basic, or C++ project. You can also use class diagrams to understand your project structure better or reorganize your code.

## What you can do with class diagrams

-   **Design**: Edit your project's code by editing the class diagram. Add new elements and delete unwanted ones. Your changes are reflected in code.

-   **Visualize**: Understand your project's structure by viewing the classes in your project on a diagram. Customize your diagram so that you can focus on the project details that you care about the most. Save your diagram to use later for demonstration or documentation.

-   **Refactor**: Override methods, rename identifiers, refactor parameters, and implement interfaces and abstract classes.
